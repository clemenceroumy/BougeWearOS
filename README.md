## Features
### Companion
At first, you need to pick a companion to take care of. 
Your companion has 3 statistics : Hungriness, Happiness and Health.

If one of the stat goes down to 0, your companion will unfortunately die :( Do everything you can to not let it happen !

In case your companion dies, you can always restart a new adventure with another one. (You'll also be able to see your previous companion in a dedicated screen)

### Statistics
- **Happiness** : to keep your companion happy, you need to :
    - pet it, play with it, feed it treats
    - send it to your computer, where it'll be free to wander and hopefully get back with items
- **Hungriness** : feed it enough with items you can buy in the shop
- **Health** : decided by how much you move through the day.

### Exercises 
Walks: The app auto detect walks you take. Credits are earned according to the number of steps done during walks and at the end of the day.

### Shop
The place where you can spend the credits you earned by doing exercises.
You can buy food and new backgrounds.

### Desktop

The watch app come with a desktop companion app. If you've installed it, you can connect your computer with your watch to send your companion inside your PC and watch it stroll over your screen !
Doing so will give your companion all its happiness hearts when it comes back.  
Your companion might also find items from its outdoor outing, so it might be worth it to let it see outside from time to time.

⚠️Your companion can be only in one place at a time. Which means that of you send it to your desktop, you won't be able to play with it on the watch.
(When your companion's on your desktop, stats are frozen, so you won't lose happiness, hungriness or health)
